# Codetech-py.TASK

Explanation of the Program:

1.Function Definitions:

- Defined functions for basic arithmetic operations such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, and exponentiate.
  
- Each function takes two arguments (x and y) and performs the respective operation.

2.Main calculator() Function:

- Displays a menu with operation options and prompts the user to select an operation or quit.

- Takes user input for choice and numbers.

- Calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice and prints the result.

- Includes a loop to allow continuous calculation until the user chooses to quit ('6').

3.Error Handling:

- Handles division by zero by checking if the divisor is zero before performing division.

4.Menu Options:

- Users can choose from five arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation).

- Choosing '6' exits the program.

5.Input Validation:

- Checks if the user input is valid within the range of available options ('1' to '6').

6.Execution:

- When executed, the program displays the menu and waits for user input.

- After performing the selected operation, it either continues with another operation or exits based on user choice.


This program provides a simple yet functional calculator with basic arithmetic operations and handles user input and errors gracefully. Users can perform calculations repeatedly until they choose to quit the program.
